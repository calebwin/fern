# Fern
![Example graphics given by a designer (above), sample graphics generated by synthesized program (below)](https://i.imgur.com/xaWn95Q.png)
Fern is a tool that synthesizes programs that can generate large quantities of plant graphics. If you're a graphic designer, you can provide a single example of the kind of the plant graphics you want a program to be able to generate, and Fern will automatically synthesize the program that generates them.
The source code is in [`src/main.rkt`](https://github.com/calebwin/fern/blob/master/src/main.rkt)
